    "description": "This document is a contract outlining the terms and conditions between LCA and its supply vendor.",
    "summary": "This bill amends the Texas Water Code to prevent groundwater conservation districts from issuing permits that would allow an applicant to export more than 5% of the district’s modeled available groundwater. It ensures that all permits combined for any applicant stay within this cap. The act applies only to new permits issued after its effective date, which is set for 91 days after the legislative session ends."
