    "summary": "This amendment updates the original vendor agreement by shortening delivery timelines, adjusting payment processing to a 21-day window, and expanding the vendor’s scope to include digital learning software. It also extends renewal terms to two-year cycles and adds a new requirement for annual compliance verification. All other terms of the original contract remain in effect."
