which PARD is certified under. The 2024 NRPA Agency Performance Review does not
provide specific metrics for soccer fields and programming needs based on size
and population. Instead, it provides metrics based on a “typical” agency (median
of data collected). The breakdown of the most common responses for a population
of jurisdiction over 250,000 is one rectangular field for every 14,238
residents. Based on Austin’s current population of 987,567, NRPA metric would
recommend that Austin have at least 69 rectangular fields. Austin currently
exceeds that number, with parkland currently providing 106 field locations that
are suitable for soccer play and open to the public, of which there are 76
multi-field spaces for informal play, 26 dedicated soccer fields, and 4 mini
pitch locations. PARD is adding lighting to existing soccer fields at Dove
Springs District Park to create more playing time. There is also a plan to add a
multi-purpose field at Springfield Pocket Park along William Cannon but funding
has not yet been identified. Additionally, this resolution directed the City
Manager to provide an assessment of all City of Austin Park Vision Plans to
identify opportunities for soccer field development for all levels of play. City
of Austin Park Vision Plans are developed through an extensive community
engagement process and are used to prioritize park development. While the
national vision planning model doesn’t identify soccer as a specific park use,
PARD has received community feedback to incorporate this into Austin vision
plans.. These uses are often labeled “open play” or “multi-use fields” meaning
areas in the park that can be used for soccer or other field sports/activities.
PARD purchased the Walnut Creek Sports Complex (228 acres located along Johnny
Morris Road in northeast Austin), specially to develop sports fields to promote
organized play such as softball, baseball, soccer fields, and tennis courts.
This complex has not yet been developed. A Request For Information (RFI) process
was completed to find a partner for the development of the complex through a
public-private collaboration. Unfortunately, we were unable yield any results.
This facility remains in the PARD inventory and could be developed in the future
if the significant funding required becomes available. Collaboration This
resolution directed the City Manager to seek public and private partnerships to
expand public access to soccer facilities and programs and to attract new soccer
sporting events to the City, including considering establishing an interest
group coalition with appropriate stakeholder organizations. PARD has partnered
with 4 ATX Foundation, a non-profit arm of Austin FC to build public use mini
pitch courts on underutilized tennis courts at parks to include: Wooldridge
School Park, Dove Springs District Park, and Civitan Neighborhood Park. The City
of Austin celebrated the recent formation of the Verde Pitch Alliance (VPA) and
its aim to bring more free and public soccer spaces to Central Texas to increase
the number of fields and parks that can be utilized to play soccer at all levels
of play, including additional mini-pitches and fields. This coalition includes
Street Soccer USA, Austin Parks Foundation, Soccer Assist, Austin FC, and 4ATX
Foundation. PARD has organized initial discussions between VPA’s built
environment soccer partners with City of Austin representatives, including
representatives from Watershed Protection, Development Services, and Parks and
Recreation’s landscape architecture team. The aim of these initial discussions
is to explore processes and strategies to more easily facilitate the development
of these facilities with support from city agencies. In 2021, PARD issued a
Request for Interest to gauge the private sector’s interest in investing in
parkland development. The RFI received little interest due to expensive upfront
infrastructure costs. In January of 2024, PARD partnered with Austin Sports
Commission to hire The Sports Facilities Companies to develop a marketing
opportunity analysis and detailed financial forecast related to the future
development of Walnut Creek Sports Complex. The final report has not been
completed, but when it is it will provide guidance on the level of public
investment needed to attract potential interest in further development.
Additionally, this resolution directed the City Manager to foster collaboration
between the City, County, school districts, soccer leagues and organizations in
Austin. Existing soccer programming, soccer leagues, community programs, and
youth soccer programs that are provided on public parkland include
collaborations between the City of Austin, Austin Independent School District
(AISD), and many soccer organizations. It is widely recognized that public land
owned and managed by the County, City or School District is currently used for
informal soccer play. In 2025, Travis County initiated development of its
10-year Long Range Plan, and our understanding is that their focus will be on
developing more nature-based parks rather than field-based sports facilities.
Recommendations This resolution directed the City Manager to review whether the
recommendations to address the identified challenges, including park maintenance
and soccer field development, could be funded through general fund expenditures
and/or bond instruments to be approved at a future election. PARD has identified
future opportunities to grow the sport, but these require additional resources
for development. The traditional ways PARD has funded these improvements have
been through Park Bonds, parkland dedication funds, grants and through
partnerships. Once development dollars are secured, there may be impacts to the
General Fund that include maintenance of the fields, as well as utility
expenses.",07/03/2025 04:25:03 PM,

through the Urban Forest Grant. The Urban Forest Replenishment Fund allocation
from the Urban Forest Replenishment Fund to the Parks and Recreation (PARD) CIP
increased from $300,000 to $1,050,000 for tree planting projects (beyond any
mitigation requirements) for park development projects. City Council approved
amending PARD’s budget to accept the funding on November 21, 2024. PARD is
working on multiple tree planting projects with the funds available through the
Urban Forest Replenishment Fund. Ecological restoration including tree planting
in Zilker Metro Park and Roy G. Guerrero Colorado River Metro Park will utilize
this funding source and the scopes of work are in the early planning stages.
Grand Meadow Neighborhood Park will plan to utilize the funding for tree
planting unless an alternative funding source is identified. The Onion Creek All
Abilities Playground has also been identified as a priority; however it will be
several years before it is ready for new trees. With access to this funding
source for park development projects, PARD will be able to plant trees above and

construction related to Phase 2 of improvements at the Emma S. Barrientos
Mexican American Cultural Center. Monthly construction project updates are
emailed to stakeholders sharing construction progress. As of February, 2025, the
Zocalo was 80% complete, mechanical equipment installation was 50% complete, and
brick and window installation was underway. Major construction activities are
expected to be completed in Summer 2025, followed by a grand opening in the
Fall. The George Washington Carver Museum and Cultural Center (Carver) and Asian
American Resource Center (AARC) received $7.5 million and $7 million,
respectively, through the 2018 Bond Program to assist with near-term building
improvements and plan for future phases of expansion as described in the
Facility Expansion Plans for each site. The Carver facility expansion project
published a request for qualifications (RFQ) in October 2024 for design services
and cost estimates. Contract and negotiations for the design team are expected
to be completed in late spring 2025. Community engagement for the phase 1
facility expansion has been completed. The process included two open house
community meetings (one in-person and one virtual), four small-group meetings
(two in-person and two virtual), a meeting with the Carver Ambassadors, a
meeting with Carver staff, and a final open house to share and confirm the
results with the community. This input will directly inform the phase 1 facility
expansion design, ensuring it reflects the voices of those who use and care
about the Carver. The AARC, as part of its Phase 2 improvements, completed the
design development phase for a pavilion in February 2025 and are currently
working to reconcile the design with the available budget before proceeding with
construction documents.",04/30/2025 02:22:38 PM,

(3) Annual Fire Inspections for High-Quality Childcare Programs. At that
meeting, Mayor Pro Tem Fuentes expressed interest in expanding waivers to also
support construction of new childcare programs. During the budget process, EDD
staff collaborated with District 2 to advance Resolution 08132025-004, granting
authority to expand waivers to construction costs. Council approved the item,
and on August 26, 2025, EDD briefed District 2 on the recommendation to create a
new waiver category specifically for construction of new childcare programs.
District 2 staff supported the recommendation and will brief the Councilwoman
for feedback. EDD anticipates issuing a memo response to Mayor and Council by
Friday, September 19. In the meantime, staff are finalizing the program
application, updating the website, and preparing marketing materials, with full
program implementation planned for October.",09/02/2025 09:06:27 PM,"[""CREATIVE"",""SERVICES""]"
